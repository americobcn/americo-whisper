### Clean Build Timing Summary

> **Note:** These are aggregated task times across all CPU cores. Because Xcode runs many tasks in parallel, these totals typically exceed the actual build wait time shown above. A large number here does not mean it is blocking your build.

## Build Settings Audit

### Debug Configuration

- [x] `SWIFT_COMPILATION_MODE`: `(unset)` (recommended: `incremental`)
- [x] `SWIFT_OPTIMIZATION_LEVEL`: `-Onone` (recommended: `-Onone`)
- [x] `GCC_OPTIMIZATION_LEVEL`: `0` (recommended: `0`)
- [x] `ONLY_ACTIVE_ARCH`: `YES` (recommended: `YES`)
- [x] `DEBUG_INFORMATION_FORMAT`: `dwarf` (recommended: `dwarf`)
- [x] `ENABLE_TESTABILITY`: `YES` (recommended: `YES`)
- [ ] `EAGER_LINKING`: `(unset)` (recommended: `YES`)

### General (All Configurations)

- [ ] `COMPILATION_CACHING`: `(unset)` (recommended: `YES`)

### Release Configuration

- [x] `SWIFT_COMPILATION_MODE`: `wholemodule` (recommended: `wholemodule`)
- [ ] `SWIFT_OPTIMIZATION_LEVEL`: `(unset)` (recommended: `-O`)
- [ ] `GCC_OPTIMIZATION_LEVEL`: `(unset)` (recommended: `s`)
- [ ] `ONLY_ACTIVE_ARCH`: `(unset)` (recommended: `NO`)
- [x] `DEBUG_INFORMATION_FORMAT`: `dwarf-with-dsym` (recommended: `dwarf-with-dsym`)
- [ ] `ENABLE_TESTABILITY`: `(unset)` (recommended: `NO`)

### Cross-Target Consistency

- [x] `SWIFT_COMPILATION_MODE` is consistent across all targets
- [x] `SWIFT_OPTIMIZATION_LEVEL` is consistent across all targets
- [x] `ONLY_ACTIVE_ARCH` is consistent across all targets
- [x] `DEBUG_INFORMATION_FORMAT` is consistent across all targets

## Compilation Diagnostics

Threshold: 100ms | Total warnings: 0 | Function bodies: 0 | Expressions: 0

No type-checking hotspots found above threshold.

## Prioritized Recommendations

### 1. Set `EAGER_LINKING` to `YES` for Debug

**Category:** build-settings
**Evidence:** Current value: `(unset)`. Allows linker to start before all compilation finishes, reducing wall-clock time.
**Impact:** Medium
**Confidence:** High
**Risk:** Low

### 2. Enable `COMPILATION_CACHING = YES`

**Category:** build-settings
**Evidence:** Current value: `(unset)`. Caches compilation results so repeat builds of unchanged inputs are served from cache. Measured 5-14% faster clean builds across tested projects; benefit compounds during branch switching and pulling changes.
**Impact:** High
**Confidence:** High
**Risk:** Low

### 3. Set `SWIFT_OPTIMIZATION_LEVEL` to `-O` for Release

**Category:** build-settings
**Evidence:** Current value: `(unset)`. Optimized binaries for production (-Osize also acceptable).
**Impact:** Medium
**Confidence:** High
**Risk:** Low

### 4. Set `GCC_OPTIMIZATION_LEVEL` to `s` for Release

**Category:** build-settings
**Evidence:** Current value: `(unset)`. Optimizes C/ObjC for size in release.
**Impact:** Medium
**Confidence:** High
**Risk:** Low

### 5. Set `ONLY_ACTIVE_ARCH` to `NO` for Release

**Category:** build-settings
**Evidence:** Current value: `(unset)`. Release builds must include all architectures for distribution.
**Impact:** Medium
**Confidence:** High
**Risk:** Low

### 6. Set `ENABLE_TESTABILITY` to `NO` for Release

**Category:** build-settings
**Evidence:** Current value: `(unset)`. Removes internal-symbol export overhead from release builds.
**Impact:** Medium
**Confidence:** High
**Risk:** Low


## Approval Checklist

- [ ] **1. Set `EAGER_LINKING` to `YES` for Debug** -- Impact: Medium | Risk: Low
- [ ] **2. Enable `COMPILATION_CACHING = YES`** -- Impact: High | Risk: Low
- [ ] **3. Set `SWIFT_OPTIMIZATION_LEVEL` to `-O` for Release** -- Impact: Medium | Risk: Low
- [ ] **4. Set `GCC_OPTIMIZATION_LEVEL` to `s` for Release** -- Impact: Medium | Risk: Low
- [ ] **5. Set `ONLY_ACTIVE_ARCH` to `NO` for Release** -- Impact: Medium | Risk: Low
- [ ] **6. Set `ENABLE_TESTABILITY` to `NO` for Release** -- Impact: Medium | Risk: Low

## Next Steps

After implementing approved changes, re-benchmark with the same inputs:

```bash
python3 scripts/benchmark_builds.py \
  --project americo-whisper.xcodeproj \
  --scheme americo-whisper \
  --configuration Debug \
  --destination "platform=macOS" \
  --output-dir .build-benchmark
```

Compare the new wall-clock medians against the baseline. Report results as:
"Your [clean/incremental] build now takes X.Xs (was Y.Ys) -- Z.Zs faster/slower."
